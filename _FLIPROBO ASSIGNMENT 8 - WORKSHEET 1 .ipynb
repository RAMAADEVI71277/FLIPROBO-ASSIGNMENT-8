    "Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables they are considering, and the number of independent variables getting used. There are many names for a regressionâ€™s dependent variable.  It may be called an outcome variable, criterion variable, endogenous variable, or regressand.  The independent variables can be called exogenous variables, predictor variables, or regressors."

    "Simple linear regression has only one x and one y variable. Multiple linear regression has one y and two or more x variables. For instance, when we predict rent based on square feet alone that is simple linear regression. When we predict rent based on square feet and age of the building that is an example of multiple linear regression."
