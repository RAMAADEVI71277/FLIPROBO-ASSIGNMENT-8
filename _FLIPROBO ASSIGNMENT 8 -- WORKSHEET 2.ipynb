It is used when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large (at least 30). The t-distribution, also called the Student's t-distribution, is similar to the z-distribution, but has fatter tails and is sensitive to sample size. It is used when the population standard deviation is unknown or the sample size is small (less than 30). As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the z-distribution."
