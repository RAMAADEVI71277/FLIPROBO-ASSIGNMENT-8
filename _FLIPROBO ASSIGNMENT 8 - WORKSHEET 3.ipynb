    "ANSWER:\n",
    "   An imbalanced classification problem is an example of a classification problem where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed.\n",
    "Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class. This results in models that have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class.\n",

    "1) Under-sampling\n",
    "Under-sampling balances the dataset by reducing the size of the abundant class. This method is used when quantity of data is sufficient. \n",
    "By keeping all samples in the rare class and randomly selecting an equal number of samples in the abundant class, a balanced new dataset can be retrieved for further modelling.\n",

    "2) Over-sampling\n",
    "On the contrary, oversampling is used when the quantity of data is insufficient. It tries to balance dataset by increasing the size of rare samples. \n",

    "In this case, the K-means clustering algorithm is independently applied to minority and majority class instances. This is to identify clusters in the dataset. \n",

    "# Q15) List down some of the evaluation metric used to evaluate a regression model. Explain each of them \n",
    "in brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    " There are three main errors (metrics) used to evaluate models, Mean absolute error, Mean Squared error and R2 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Lets take an example where we have some points. We have a line that fits those points.When we do a summation of the absolute value distance from the points to the line, we get Mean absolute error.The problem with this metric is that it is not differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): Mean Squared Error solves differentiability problem of the MAE. Consider the same diagram above. We have a line that fits those points. When we do a summation of the square of distances from the points to the line, we get Mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "R2 Score: R2 score answers the question that if this simple model has a larger error than the linear regression model. However, it terms of metrics the answer we need is how much larger.\n",
    "The R2 score answers this question. R2 score is 1 — (Error from Linear Regression Model/Simple average model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R² score of 0.0.   "
